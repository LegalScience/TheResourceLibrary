These files were collected and shared with Eve Maler in early January 2014 for purpose of level-setting on next steps with the UMA Binding Obligations specifications and replying to her inquiries regarding trends, promising practices and prior art.

Below is an excerpt from the transmittal email to which the files were attached:

* Currently I've got a couple of relevant projects needing this type of functionality:
 - One project is focused on selecting the right terms to include in an open source license for use by people managing projects in the City of Boston (see attachments starting "A--Boston-" for the template approach to those contracts, and note the "ShareBack" provision carries obligations for developers who distribute the code, specifically requiring notice and delivery of the code back to the licensor by way of a pull-request); 
 - Another project is for the "ClearButton" initiative, an openPDS and Identity system designed for individuals and organizations to manage mass-scale legal notices and access to personal data (more on this soon) and the end-user and participating organization agreements are intended to be fully dynamic and treated as both contracts and OAuth 2 scope based authorizations among contracting parties;
 - See the A--OIDC-ScopeTermsAutomationConcept zip contents for more up to date general direction being followed for this Terms of Auth approach).

* The StateDecoded project is a related effort I'm working on diligently that involves markup/coding of state and federal statutes or regulations as well as municipal ordinances in json/xml structures and includes a nifty API for access and computation... I'm spearheading a couple of new initiatives for this project using Boston Ordinances and potentially Regulations of the State of Kansas).  This project is very cool in part due to it's orientation around REST interfaces used to express the laws as a proper web 2.0 "service" (and please note that these public laws are comprised of many types of rules that could just as easily be private law based contract rules in many instances). and StateDecoded also sports a working open source parser which we are working to make more robust... so it's worth looking at.  See the files starting "A--statedecoded" and also note the two files startig "B--API" which describe the vision of leaning on common API's for important transactions including contractual REST based services and resources.  Imagine a "programmableweb" catalog of contract API services and binding obligations apps or cool analytics? 

* I also included the very relevant OASIS eContracts final agreed requirements and specification documents, starting "A--OASIS-eContracts".  I especially commend the requirements doc for a deeper look because some of the ideas and intended outcomes are still relevant.  In this context, I encourage a scan of the file "D--EAP-Snap-In-Contracts-Brief" for a few other relevant design-phase ideas).

* The files starting "C--GitHub" relate to other digital contracts projects using GitHub (some are template driven and anticipate automation as part of the contract process with some integration with underlying transactions)

* The files starting "D--" are generally relevant and valuable secondary sources of smart people saying important things on the topic of contract and rules automation.
